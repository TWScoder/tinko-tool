# Tinko Tool Docs

The tinko-tool program is my program that is built up of my programs and uses the case feature so you operate by using this context, 'tinko-tool *Option Goes Here*'.
I have also added my editor feautre so you can do editor.*Program Want To Edit* to edit the code of the program using vim or you can select the editor by chaning the editor varible in
the code.
